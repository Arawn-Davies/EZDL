# EZDL
Front-end for Youtube-dl

Currently EZDL (Easy Downloader) is Windows only, but there are plans in the future to extend this to other platforms, such as Linux and UNIX-like operating systems. 

The command line utility and included graphical user interface only calls (no static/dynamic linking!) the Youtube-dl (and therefore FFMPEG) binaries, so AFAIK I'm not required to release this utility under any GPL license. IMHO, GPL has both good and bad points, but for this small application I'd rather not release it under GPL.  

Youtube-dl can be found at https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl  
The specific FFMPEG build used can be found at https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds
